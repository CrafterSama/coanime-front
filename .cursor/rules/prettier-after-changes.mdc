# Prettier After Frontend Changes

After editing any file in the frontend, **always run Prettier** on the modified files. Unformatted code often causes the deploy pipeline to fail.

## What to do

1. After creating or modifying frontend files, run Prettier on those files before finishing the task.
2. From the **frontend** directory you can:
   - Format only the files you changed:  
     `npx prettier --write <file1> <file2> ...`
   - Or format the whole project:  
     `npm run format`

## Example

If you edited `src/pages/ecma/titulos/estrenos/index.tsx`, run:

```bash
cd frontend && npx prettier --write src/pages/ecma/titulos/estrenos/index.tsx
```

Do not skip this step; deploy checks typically run Prettier and fail when files are not formatted.
